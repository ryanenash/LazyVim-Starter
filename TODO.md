# Todo 

- [] All popup borders rounded, e.g. documentation hover, lazyvim, noice, mason
- [] Snacks.nvim terminal does not position for typing correctly if reopened, only if opening a new terminal
  - Fixed by pressing enter, can we do an autocmd?
- [] Set up markdown, js/ts/json files, and vimtex
- [x] Zen mode and dimming not working with transparent color scheme 
  - Just use same color scheme as terminal in non-transparent mode (tokynonight-night)
- [x] Lua warnings in nvim config files
  - Caused by LazyVim/LazyDev interactions
